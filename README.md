# Why? 
## Every time I plug in my audio interface, I have to adjust the system settings to send the audio out to my studio display. This script is a shortcut.
# SETUP
1. `brew install switchaudio-osx`
2. add the script somewhere
3. Run the script: ~/.scripts/switch_audio.sh
4. profit: 
```
ðŸ”Š Studio Display Speakers
ðŸŽ¤ Studio Display Microphone
```

Adjust the script to connect to inputs and outputs of your preference.
